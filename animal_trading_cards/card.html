			<p>Lions are large felines that are traditionally depicted as the "king of the jungle." These big cats once roamed Africa, Asia and Europe, but are now found in only two areas of the world and are classified into two subspecies. Asiatic lions in India's Gir Forest; African lions in central and southern Africa.</p>
